To change the latest commit message on GitHub, you can use the following steps:

1. **Amend the last commit:**
   Run the command below to modify the last commit message:
   ```bash
   git commit --amend -m "New commit message"
   ```

   This will change the message of the most recent commit.

2. **Push the amended commit:**
   After amending the commit, you need to force push it to your remote repository:
   ```bash
   git push --force
   ```

### Things to note:
- **Force-pushing** is required because you are rewriting the history. Be careful if you're working on a shared branch, as this might affect collaborators.
- This only affects the **most recent** commit. If you want to modify older commits, you would need to perform a more complex rebase.

When you push without `--force` after amending a commit, Git doesn't overwrite the original commit and instead pushes both the amended and original commits, resulting in duplicate commits. To fix this and remove the old commit, you'll need to force-push the correct history.

Here’s what you should do:

1. **Check your commit history:**
   Run the following command to see your recent commits:
   ```bash
   git log --oneline
   ```
   You should see both the old and the amended commits.

2. **Reset your branch to the amended commit:**
   Assuming the amended commit is the most recent one, you can reset your branch to it by using:
   ```bash
   git reset --hard HEAD~1
   ```
   This command will remove the duplicate (unwanted) commit from your local history.

3. **Force push the corrected history:**
   After resetting, force-push to update the remote repository with the corrected commit history:
   ```bash
   git push --force
   ```

Now, the old commit should be removed from both your local and remote repositories, and only the amended commit should remain. Let me know if you need further assistance!


If someone else has committed after you, or you want to change a commit that's not the most recent, you should be more careful to avoid disrupting others' work. Here’s how to handle both cases:

### Case 1: You want to change a **previous commit** (not the latest one)

1. **Interactive rebase**: You can use an interactive rebase to change a previous commit message. Run:
   ```bash
   git rebase -i HEAD~n
   ```
   Replace `n` with the number of commits you want to go back (e.g., if the commit you want to change is 3 commits back, use `HEAD~3`).

2. **Edit the commit**: In the editor that opens, you'll see a list of recent commits. Find the commit you want to change and replace `pick` with `reword`. Then save and close the editor.

3. **Modify the commit message**: Another editor will open for you to modify the commit message. After changing it, save and close the editor.

4. **Complete the rebase**: After editing, Git will complete the rebase. If there are no conflicts, the process will finish smoothly.

5. **Force push the changes**: Since you’ve rewritten commit history, you'll need to force-push:
   ```bash
   git push --force
   ```

### Case 2: **Someone else committed after you** or you're on a **shared branch**

If you're on a shared branch and someone else has pushed commits after your last one, avoid rewriting history directly. Instead, follow these steps:

1. **Pull the latest changes**: First, ensure your local branch has all the latest commits from the remote by pulling the changes:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   ```

2. **Amend your commit**: If you want to change only **your commit**, you can follow the same `git commit --amend` process to modify the latest commit **before pushing**.

3. **Interactive rebase**: If you need to modify a previous commit in the history (not the latest one), you can use `git rebase -i` as mentioned in **Case 1**, but:

   - **Be cautious** with shared branches. If others have based their work on commits you're rewriting, this can cause issues.

4. **Force push with care**: After completing your changes, you'll need to force-push:
   ```bash
   git push --force-with-lease
   ```
   Using `--force-with-lease` is safer than `--force` because it checks that no one else has pushed changes to the remote branch after you. It prevents accidentally overwriting others' work.

### General Tips:
- **Communicate**: If you're working in a shared repository, notify your team before force-pushing changes.
- **Check the branch**: Always check if someone else has made changes before force-pushing by pulling the latest updates.

These methods allow you to safely modify commit history while minimizing the risk of disrupting others' work.
