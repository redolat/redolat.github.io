Certainly! Here's a brief explanation of the GitHub commit prefixes you're using:

1. **feat:**  
   Indicates a new feature added to the codebase. Use this for significant changes that introduce new functionality.
   - Example: `feat: add user login feature`

2. **fix:**  
   Used when fixing a bug. This is for any code changes that address a problem or bug in the code.
   - Example: `fix: correct login validation error`

3. **chore:**  
   Refers to routine tasks or changes that don't modify application functionality. This could include maintenance tasks, dependency updates, or refactoring code that doesn’t affect the app’s behavior.
   - Example: `chore: update dependencies`

4. **docs:**  
   Used for documentation changes. This includes updating or adding documentation, such as README files, comments, or inline documentation.
   - Example: `docs: update API usage in README`

### Additional Common Prefixes:

5. **style:**  
   Used for changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc.).
   - Example: `style: format code with Prettier`

6. **refactor:**  
   A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature, but improves code structure or readability.
   - Example: `refactor: simplify login logic`

7. **test:**  
   For adding or updating tests. This is useful when writing new tests or modifying existing ones.
   - Example: `test: add unit tests for login feature`

8. **perf:**  
   Indicates a code change that improves performance. Use this for optimizations that enhance the efficiency of the application.
   - Example: `perf: improve login speed by optimizing query`

9. **ci:**  
   Used for Continuous Integration changes, like updating configuration files for build systems or adding CI/CD pipelines.
   - Example: `ci: configure Travis CI for testing`

10. **build:**  
    Refers to changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (e.g., gulp, npm).
    - Example: `build: update webpack configuration`

These prefixes follow the **Conventional Commits** specification and help in maintaining a clean and structured commit history.
